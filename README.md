### Running development server

You can start the application by first running `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
and then bootstrapping the development server with `yarn dev`.

### Building and running your application

You can easily build the application by running `yarn build` and then bootstrapping with `yarn start:prod`.

If you are afraid of running it locally, you can use docker compose with
`docker compose up --build`.
